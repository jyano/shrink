 
  They observe Mds, but don’t directly communicate with them.

Controllers handle input (e.g., clicks, user actions)
 and update Mds.

 merge responsibility of Controller into Vw,  

For this reason we refer to such frameworks as following MV* pattern; 
that is, you’re likely to haveMd andVw, butdistinct Controller might not be present and other components may come into play.

   

There’slot more that goes into structuring app than tying togetherDOM manipulation 
lib, templating, and routing. Mature MV* frameworks typically include not only pieces you would find yourself writing, 
but also include sols to problems you’ll find yourself running into later on down road. This istime-saver that you shouldn’t underestimate val of.



using dif pattern called Md2.
 Rails does not notify views from md or   cos - it just passes md data directly to view.


 even for server-side workflow of receiving rq from URL, 
baking out HTML page as response and separating your business logic 
from your interface has  benefits. 

In same way that keeping your UI cleanly separated from your db records is useful in server-side frameworks, 
it’s equally as useful to keep your UI cleanly separated from your data mds in 
JavaScript (as we will read more about shortly).


  Zend ->  Front Controller design pattern. -> layers MVC stack behindsingle point of entry. 
  This single point of entry means that all HTTP requests
 (e.g., http://www.example.com, http://www.example.com/whichever-page/, etc.)
  are routed by server’s configuration to same handler, independent of URI.


When Front Controller receives HTTP request it analyzes it and decides which class (Controller) and met (Action) to invoke. 

The selected Controller Action takes over and interacts with appropriate Md to fulfill request. 

The Controller receives data back from Md,
 loads appropriate Vw, injects Md data into it, and returns response to  bw.

For example, 
let’s say we have our blog on www.example.com 
and we want to edit article (with id=43)
 and request http://www.example.com/article/edit/43:


On server side, Front Controller would analyze URL and invoke Article Controller (corresponding to /article/ part of URI)
 and its Edit Action (corresponding to /edit/ part of URI). Within Action there would becall to, let’s say,
  Articles Md and its Articles::getEntry(43) met (43 corresponding to /43 at end of URI). 
  
  This would return blog article data from db for editing. 
  The Article Controller would then load (article/edit) Vw which would include logic for injecting article’s data intoform suitable for editing its 
  content, tt, and other (meta) data. Finally, resulting HTML response would be returned to  bw.


As you can imagine,similar flow is necessary with POST requests after we presssave bt inform. The POST action URI would look like /article/save/43. 
The request would go through same Controller, but this time Save Action would be invoked (due to /save/ URI chunk),
 Articles Md would save edited article to db with Articles::saveEntry(43), and  bw would be redirected to /article/edit/43 URI for further editing.


Finally, if user requested http://www.example.com/ Front Controller would invoke default Controller and Action; e.g., 
the Index Controller and its Index action. Within Index Action there would becall to Articles md and its Articles::getLastEntries(10)
 met which would return last 10 blog posts. The Controller would load blog/index Vw which would have basic logic for listing blog posts.

The picture below shows this typical HTTP request/response lifecycle for server-side MVC:


The Server receives HTTP request and routes it throughsingle entry point. 
At that entry point, Front Controller analyzes request and, based on it,
 invokes Action of appropriate Controller. This process is called routing.
  The Action Md is asked to return and/or save submitted data. 
  
   Md comms with data source (e.g., db or API). 
  Once Md completes its work it returns data  Co which then loads appropriate Vw. 
  The Vw executes presentation logic (loops through articles and prints tts, content, etc.)
   using supplied data. 
   In end, HTTP response is returned to  bw.



 ///



Our example will need div el to which we can attach list of Td’s.
 It will also need HTML tp containing placeholder for
 Td item tt and completion checkbox which can be instantiated for Td item instances.
  These are provided by following HTML:

 
  <div id="td">   </div>

  <script type="text/tp" id="item-tp">
    <div class="view">
      <input id="td_complete" type="checkbox" <%= completed ? 'checked="checked"' : '' %> />
      <label><%= tt %></label>
      <bt class="destroy"></bt>
    </div>
    <input class="edit" val="<%= tt %>">
  </script>
 
 
Td = bb.Md.x({    df: {  tt: '',  completed: false  }})


td = new Td({  tt: 'Check atts property of logged mds in console.' })


TdVw = $V({t:  'li',


  tdTpl: _.tp(  $('#item-tp').h()  ), // Cache tp function for a single item.


  ev: { 'dblclick label': 'edit',    'keypress .edit': 'updateOnEnter',   'blur .edit':   'close'  },


  // Called when view is first created
   // Later we'll look at: this.l2(someCl, 'all', this.render);
      // but you can actually run this example right now by calling tdVw.r();
  i: function() {    this.$el = $('#td') },


  // Re-render tts of td item.
    //     statement is replacing HTML of el  with result of instantiatingtp with md's atts.
  r: function() {    this.$el.h( this.tdTpl( this.md.atts ) ); this.input = this.$('.edit');    return this;  },
  edit: function() {  },    // executed when td label is double clicked
  close: function() {  }, // executed when td loses focus
  updateOnEnter: function( e ) {}    // executed on each keypress when in td edit mode,  but we'll wait for enter to get in action
  
})



tdVw = new TdVw({m: td})

 Each call to r() will replace content of li el using current Md data.





  Td Md viewing happens in user interface in list of all Td items.
 Within it, each Td is rendered with its tt and completed checkbox.
  Md editing is done through “edit” Vw
  where user who has selected spec Td edits its tt inform.

  add our r() cb as Md subscriber,
so Vw can be triggered to update when Md changes.

You may wonder where user interaction comes into play here.
When users click onTd el within Vw, it’s not Vw’s responsibility to know what to do next.
A Controller makes this decision.
In bb, this is achieved by adding event listener to Td’s el which delegates handling of click to event handler.




   Variables are delimited usingvar syntax (e.g <%= tt %> for Underscore and {{tt}} for Handlebars).


Handlebars.js:

<div class="view">
  <input class="toggle" type="checkbox" {{#if completed}} checked {{/if}}>
  <label>{{tt}}</label>
  <bt class="destroy"></bt>
</div>
<input class="edit" val="{{tt}}">
Underscore.js Microtps:

<div class="view">
  <input class="toggle" type="checkbox" <%= completed ? 'checked' : '' %>>
  <label><%= tt %></label>
  <bt class="destroy"></bt>
</div>
<input class="edit" val="<%= tt %>">
You may also use double curly brackets (i.e {{}}) (or any other tag you feel comfortable with) in Microtps.
In case of curly brackets, this can be done by setting Underscore tpSettings attr as follows:

_.tpSettings = { interpolate : /\{\{(.+?)\}\}/g };




 
 role of navigation thus falls to“router”, which assists in managing app state
  (e.g., allowing users to bookmarkparticular view they have navigated to).




Controllers
In our Tdo app,Controller would be responsible for handling changes user made in edit Vw forparticular Td,
 updating spec Td Md whenuser has finished editing.
 
 
  bb’s Vws typically contain “Controller” logic, and Routers are used to help manage app state,
  but neither are true Controllers according to classical MVC.

  bb   MV* family 
  which approaches architecture in its own way. 
  
  distinguish between classical MVC and MV* 
 

 MVC  variation of three other classical design patterns:
  Observer (Publish/Subscribe),
   Strategy, and Composite patterns.
    may also use Factory and Decorator patterns.
     
     
    read “JavaScript Design Patterns For Beginners”  

As we’ve discussed, Mds rep app data,
 while Vws handle what user is presented on screen. 
  MVC relies on Publish/Subscribe for some of its core communication
 
 
   When a Md is changed it “publishes” to rest of app that it has been updated. 
   
   The subscriberCo   then updates Vw accordingly. 
   The observer-viewer nature of this relationship is what facilitates multiple Vws being attached to same Md.

Cos facilitate Vws’ responses to  dif user ip and are example of Strategy pattern.
 

 You can also use Console   multi-line editor using  Ctrl + Enter shortcut on Mac 
 to move from end of one line to start of another.

Td = bb.Md.x({}) //create md
td1 = new Td() //    create Td inst w/o vals

$l(_.jS(td1)) -> {}

 
td2 = new Td({  tt: 'Check atts of both md instances in console.', completed: true})

// Following logs: {"tt":"Check atts of both md instances in console.","completed":true}
$l(_.jS(td2))


Td = bb.Md.x({  i: function(){      $l('This md has been initd.')  }})
td = new Td()

Td = bb.Md.x({ df: { tt: '',    completed: false }})
td1 = new Td()

$l(_.jS(td1))-> {"tt":"","completed":false}


td2 = new Td({  tt: 'Check atts of logged mds in console.'});

  {"tt":"Check atts of logged mds in console.","completed":false}
$l(_.jS(td2));

toJSON()   returns copy of atts as object (notJSON string despite its name).
 
Setting vals through .atts  bypasses triggers bound to md.
 

Per = new bb.Md();
 Per.on("change:name", function() { $l('Name changed'); });
Per.s({n:'A'}) // log entry: Name changed

Per.s({n: 'J'}, {silent: true}); // no log entry
$l(Per.hasChanged('n')); // true: change was recorded
$l(Per.hasChanged()); // true: SOMETHING changed
  add listeners is in init() function as shown below:
  Td = bb.Md.x({
    df: { tt: '',   completed: false  },
    i: function(){  $l('This md has been initd.');    this.on('change', function(){      $l('md vals changed.')  })  }
})

td = new Td();

td.s('tt', 'listener trgd on attr val change'); $l('Title has changed: ' + td.g('tt'))
td.s('completed', true); $l('Completed has changed: ' + td.g('completed'))
td.s({  tt: 'mult attr changes trgs listner once',  completed: true })

// Above logs:
// This md has been initd.
// - Values for this md have changed.
// Title has changed: The listener is triggered whenever attr val changes.
// - Values for this md have changed.
// Completed has changed: true
// - Values for this md have changed.

You can also listen for changes to individual atts inbb md. In following example, we logmessage whenever spec attr (the tt of our Td md) is altered.

Td = bb.Md.x({
  df: {  tt: '',  completed: false },
  i: function(){    $l('This md has been initd.');
    this.on('change:tt', function(){        $l('Title val for this md has changed.')   })  },

  setTitle: function(newTitle){    this.set({ tt: newTitle }) }
})

td = new Td();

// Both of following changes trigger listener:
td.set('tt', 'Check what\'s logged.');
td.setTitle('Go fishing on Sunday.');

// But, this change type is not observed, so no listener is triggered:
td.set('completed', true);
$l('Td set as completed: ' + td.get('completed'));

// Above logs:
// This md has been initd.
// Title val for this md has changed.
// Title val for this md has changed.
// Td set as completed: true

we walk you through impl of your first bb app.

Exercise 1: Tds - Your First bb.js App

 build bb Td List app exhibited on TdMVC.com.
 
 
  architecture  level. We’ll need:

a Td md to describe individual td items
a TdList cl to store and persist tds
a way of creating tds
a way to displaylisting of tds
a way to edit existing tds
a way to marktd as completed
a way to delete tds
a way to filter items that have been completed or are remaining
Essentially  CRUD 


  
  <script src="js/lib/backbone.localStorage.js"></script>
   
 
 
You   need base.css and bg.png,which should live in assets directory.
  
   you can see demo of final app at TdMVC.com.
 
 
Now let’s populate body of index.html.
 We’ll need <input> for creating new tds,
 <ul id="td-list" /> for listing actual tds,
 and footer where we can later insert statistics 
 and links for performing operations such as clearing completed tds.
  We’ll add following markup immediately
 inside our body tag before script els:

  <section id="tdapp">
    <header id="header">
      <h1>tds</h1>
      <input id="new-td" placeholder="What needs to be done?" autofocus>
    </header>
    <section id="main">
      <input id="toggle-all" type="checkbox">
      <label for="toggle-all">Mark all as complete</label>
      <ul id="td-list"></ul>
    </section>
    <footer id="footer"></footer>
  </section>
  <div id="info">
    <p>Double-click to edittd</p>
    <p>Written by <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a></p>
    <p>Part of <a href="http://tdmvc.com">TdMVC</a></p>
  </div>
  
Tps

To complete index.html,
 we need to add tps which we will use to dynamically 
 create HTML by injecting md data into their placeholders.
 One way of including tps in page is by using cust script tags. 
 These don’t get evaluated by  bw, 
 which just interprets them as plain text.
 Underscore micro-templating can then access tps,
  rendering fragments of HTML.


We’ll start by filling in #item-tp which will be used to display individual td items.

  <!-- index.html -->

  <script type="text/tp" id="item-tp">
    <div class="view">
      <input class="toggle" type="checkbox" <%= completed ? 'checked' : '' %>>
      <label><%= tt %></label>
      <bt class="destroy"></bt>
    </div>
    <input class="edit" val="<%= tt %>">
  </script>
  
 
We also need to define #stats-tp tp which we will use to populate footer.

  <!-- index.html -->

  <script type="text/tp" id="stats-tp">
    <span id="td-count"><strong><%= remaining %></strong> <%= remaining === 1 ? 'item' : 'items' %> left</span>
    <ul id="filters">
      <li>
        <a class="selected" href="#/">All</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#/active">Active</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#/completed">Completed</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <% if (completed) { %>
    <bt id="clear-completed">Clear completed (<%= completed %>)</bt>
    <% } %>
  </script>
  
  
The #stats-tp displays number of remaining incomplete items and containslist of hyperlinks
  which will be used to perform actions when we implement our router.
 It also contains bt which can be used to clear all of completed items.

  

  app = app || {};
 
  app.Td = bb.Md.x({
    df: {  tt: '',  completed: false   },
    toggle: function() {this.save({ completed: !this.get('completed')})}
  })
  
 
Td  cl uses LocalStorage adapter to override bb’s default sync() operation
  with one that will persist our Td records to HTML5 Local Storage.
Through local storage, they’re saved between page requests.


  <script>



  // js/cls/tds.js

  app = app || {};

  TdList = bb.Cl.x({
    md: app.Td,
    localStorage: new bb.LocalStorage('tds-backbone'),  // Save all of td items under `"tds-backbone"` namespace.
    // Filter down list of all td items that are finished.
    completed: function() {return this.filter(function( td ) { return td.get('completed')   })   },
  // Filter down list to only td items that are still not finished.
    remaining: function(){return this.without.apply(this, this.completed())},
    nextOrder: function() {return this[0]? this.last().get('order')+1:1 },
  // We keep Tds in seq order, despite being saved by unord  GUID in db.  gens next order number for new items.
    comparator: function( td ) {  return td.get('order')}  // Tds are sorted by their original insertion order.
  })
  // Create our global cl of **Tds**.

  app.Tds = new TdList()

  </script>


The cl’s completed() and remaining() mets return array of finished and unfinished tds,


A nextOrder() met implements sequence generator, comparator() sorts items by their insertion order.




  we’ll use el controller pattern. consists of two views:
          one controls cl of items
          other deals with each indiv  item.

  AppVw will handle
     creation of new tds
     rendering of initial td list.

  Instances of TdVw will be assoc with each individual Td record
    - can handle edit-in-place, updating, and destroying their associated td.


 lot for us to cover in AppVw, so we’ll split our discussion into two sections.

  <script>



  // js/views/app.js

  app = app || {};

  // The Application



  app.AppVw = $V({  //  top-level piece of UI.


    el: '#tdapp',


    statsTp: _.tp( $('#stats-tp').h() ),  // Our tp for line of statistics at bottom of app.

    // At init we bind to relevant evs on `Tds` cl, when items are added or changed.

      i: function() {

          this.allCheckbox = this.$('#toggle-all')[0];
          this.$input = this.$('#new-td');
          this.$footer = this.$('#footer');
          this.$main = this.$('#main');

          this.l2(app.Tds, 'add', this.addOne);
          this.l2(app.Tds, 'reset', this.addAll);
    },



    // Addsingle td item to list by creatingview for it, and appending its el to `<ul>`.
    addOne: function( td ) {
      view = new app.TdVw({ md: td });
      $('#td-list').A( view.r().el );
    },

    // Add all items in **Tds** cl at once.


    addAll: function() {
        this.$('#td-list').h('');
        app.Tds.each(this.addOne, this)
    }


  })



      </script>



A few notable features are present in our initial version of AppVw, 
includingstats Tp,
 init met that’s implicitly called on instantiation, 
 and several view- spec mets.


An el (el) property storesselector targeting DOM el with ID of tdapp. 
In case of our app, el refers to matching <section id="tdapp" /> el in index.html.

The call to _.tp uses Underscore’s micro-templating to constructstatsTp object from our #stats-tp.
 We will use this tp later when we render our view.

Now let’s takelook at init function.
 First, it’s using jQ to cache els it will be using into local pops (recall that this.$() finds els relative to this.$el). 
 Then it’s binding to two evs on Tds cl: add and reset. Since we’re delegating handling of updates and deletes to TdVw view,
  we don’t need to worry about those here. 
  The two pieces of logic are:

When add event is fired addOne() met is called and passed new md. addOne() creates instance of TdVw view, renders it, 
and appends resulting el to our Td list.

Whenreset event occurs (i.e., we update cl in bulk as happens when Tds are loaded from Local Storage), addAll() is called,
 which iterates over all of Tds currently in our cl and fires addOne() for each item.

Note that we were able to use this within addAll() to refer to view because l2() implicitly set cb’s context to view when it created binding.

Now, let’s add some more logic to complete our AppVw!


  // js/views/app.js

      <script>
          
 
  app = app || {};

  // The Application
 
  // Our overall **AppVw** is top-level piece of UI.
  app.AppVw = bb.V.x({

    // Instead of generatingnew el, bind to existing skeleton of
    // App already present in HTML.
    el: '#tdapp',

    // Our tp for line of statistics at bottom of app.
    statsTp: _.tp( $('#stats-tp').h() ),

   
    // Delegated evs for creating new items, and clearing completed ones.
    evs: {

      'keypress #new-td': 'createOnEnter',
      'click #clear-completed': 'clearCompleted',
      'click #toggle-all': 'toggleAllComplete'
    },



    // At init we bind to relevant evs on `Tds`
    // cl, when items are added or changed. Kick things off by
    // loading any preexisting tds that might be saved in *localStorage*.
    
    i: function() {
      this.allCheckbox = this.$('#toggle-all')[0]
      this.$input = this.$('#new-td')

      this.$main = this.$('#main')

        this.$footer = this.$('#footer')

        this.l2(app.Tds, 'add', this.addOne)
        this.l2(app.Tds, 'reset', this.addAll)
        this.l2(app.Tds, 'change:completed', this.filterOne)
        this.l2(app.Tds,'filter', this.filterAll)
        this.l2(app.Tds, 'all', this.r)
        app.Tds.fetch()
    },



    //Re-rendering App just means refreshing statistics -- rest of app doesn't change.
    
    r: function() {
      
      completed = app.Tds.completed().length
      remaining = app.Tds.remaining().length

      if ( app.Tds[0] ) { this.$main.show();   this.$footer.show();

        this.$footer.h(this.statsTp({          completed: completed,  remaining: remaining  }));

        this.$('#filters li a').xK('selected').filter('[href="#/' + ( app.TdFilter || '' ) + '"]').K('selected');
      } 
      
      else {  this.$main.hide();        this.$footer.hide()    }

      this.allCheckbox.checked = !remaining;
    },

    // Addsingle td item to list by creatingview for it, and appending its el to `<ul>`.
    addOne: function( td ) {   view = new app.TdVw({ md: td });    $('#td-list').A( view.r().el )    },

   
    addAll: function() { this.$('#td-list').h('');  app.Tds.each(this.addOne, this)    }, // Add all items in **Tds** cl at once.

    filterOne : function (td){td.trigger('visible')},

    
    filterAll : function () {      app.Tds.each(this.filterOne, this)   },


       newAttributes: function() {return { tt: this.$input.val().trim(),   order: app.Tds.nextOrder(),        completed: false}    },

    
        // If you hit return in main input field, create new Td md, persisting it to localStorage.
   
    createOnEnter: function( event ) {      if ( event.which !== ENTER_KEY || !this.$input.val().trim() ) { return;    }
      app.Tds.create( this.newAttributes() ); this.$input.val('') },

   clearCompleted: function() { _.iv(app.Tds.completed(), 'destroy'); return false}, // Clear all completed td items, destroying their mds.

   toggleAllComplete: function() {completed = this.allCheckbox.checked;    app.Tds.each(function(td){td.save({'completed': completed }) })}})


          </script>
  
We have added logic for creating new tds, editing them, and filtering them based on their completed status.

evs: We’ve defined evs hash containing declarative cbs for our DOM evs. It binds those evs to following mets:
createOnEnter(): Createsnew Td md and persists it in localStorage whenuser hits enter inside <input/> field.
Also resets main <input/> field val to prepare it for next entry. The md is populated by newAttributes(),
 which returns object literal composed of tt, order, and completed state of new item. 
 Note that this is referring to view and not DOM el since cb was bound using evs hash.
clearCompleted(): Removes items in td list that have been marked as completed when user clicks clear-completed checkbox 
(this checkbox will be in footer populated by #stats-tp).
toggleAllComplete():
 Allows user to mark all of items in td list as completed by clicking toggle-all checkbox.

init(): We’ve bound cbs to several additional evs:
We’ve bound filterOne() cb on Tds cl forchange:completed event.
  This listens for changes to completed flag for any md in cl.
The affected td is passed to cb which triggerscust visible event on md.
We’ve boundfilterAll() cb forfilter event, which workslittle similar to addOne() and addAll().
 Its responsibility is to toggle which td items are visible based on filter currently selected in UI 
 (all, completed or remaining) via calls to filterOne().
We’ve used special all event to bind any event triggered on Tds cl to view’s render met (discussed below).

The init() met completes by fetching prevly saved tds from localStorage.

r(): Several things are happening in our r() met:
The #main and #footer sections are displayed or hidden
 depending on whether there are any tds in cl.

The footer is populated with HTML produced by instantiating statsTp with num  of completed and remaining td items.
The HTML produced by preceding step contains list of filter links. 
The val of app.TdFilter, which will be set by our router, 
is being used to apply class ‘selected’ to link corresponding to currently selected filter.
 This will result in conditional CSS styling being applied to that filter.
The allCheckbox is updated based on whether there are remaining tds.






Now let’s look at TdVw view. makes sure view updates when td does.
To enable this functionality,  we add ev lstnrs to vw that lstn for evs on indi td’s HTML repation.


  // js/views/tds.js

      <script>


  app = app || {}

  // Td Item Vw // The DOM el fortd item...
  
  app.TdVw = $V({

  
    t: 'li',

   
    tp: _.tp( $('#item-tp').h() ), // Cache tp function forsingle item.

    
    evs: {  'dblclick label': 'edit',  'keypress .edit': 'updateOnEnter',  'blur .edit': 'close' },// The DOM evs  spec to item.

    // The TdVw listens for changes to its md, re-rendering. Since there's
    //one-to-one correspondence between**Td** and**TdVw** in this
    // app, we setdirect reference on md for convenience.
    i: function() { this.l2(this.md, 'change', this.render)    },

    r: function() {      this.$el.h( this.tp( this.md.atts ) );      this.$input = this.$('.edit');      return this}, // Re-renders tts of td item.
    edit: function() { this.$el.K('editing');     this.$input.focus()   },   // Switch this view into `"editing"` mode, displaying input field.
    close: function() {            if ( val  = this.$input.val().trim() ) {  this.md.save({ tt: val  });      };  this.$el.xK('editing') },    // Close `"editing"` mode, saving changes to td.
    updateOnEnter: function(e){if(e.which===ENTER_KEY){this.close()}} // If you hit `enter`, we're through editing item.


  })

      </script>



In init() constructor, 
we set uplistener that monitorstd md’s change event.
 Asresult, when td gets updated, app will re-render view and visually reflect its changes.
  Note that md passed in arguments hash by our AppVw is automatically avail to us as this.md.

In r() met, we render our Underscore.js #item-tp, which was prevly compiled into this.tp 
using Underscore’s _.tp() met. 
This returns HTML fragment that replaces content of view’s el
 (an li el was implicitly created for us based on tagName property).
 In other words, rendered tp is now present under this.el and can be appended to td list in user interface.
  r()
  finishes by caching input el within instantiated tp into this.$input.

Our evs hash includes three cbs:

edit(): changes current view into editing mode whenuser double-clicks on existing item in td list. 
This allows them to change existing val of item’s tt attr.
updateOnEnter(): checks that user has hit return/enter key and executes close() function.
close(): trims val of current text in our <input/> field, 
ensuring that we don’t process it further if it does not contain any text (e.g ‘’).
 Ifvalid val has been provided, we save changes to current td md and close editing mode 
 by removing corresponding CSS class.
Startup
So now we have two views: AppVw and TdVw. 
The former needs to be instantiated on page load so its code gets executed.
 This can be accomplished through jQ’s ready() utility, which will executefunction when DOM is loaded.


  // js/app.js

  app = app || {};
  ENTER_KEY = 13;

  $(function() {

    // Kick things off by creating **App**.
    new app.AppVw();

  });
In action
Let’s pause and ensure that work we’ve done so far functions as intended.

If you are following along, open file://*path*/index.html in your  bw and monitor its console. 
If all is well, you shouldn’t see any JavaScript errors other than regarding router.js file that we haven’t created yet.
 The td list should be blank as we haven’t yet created any tds.
  Plus, there is some additional work we’ll need to do before user interface fully functions.

However,few things can be tested through JavaScript console.

In console, addnew td item: app.Tds.create({ tt: 'My first Td item'}); and hit return.


If all is functioning properly, this should log new td we’ve just added to tds cl. 
The newly created td is also saved to Local Storage and will be avail on page refresh.

app.Tds.create() executescl met (Cl.create(atts, [ops])) 
which instantiatesnew md item of type passed into cl definition, in our case app.Td:


  // from our js/cls/tds.js

  TdList = bb.Cl.x({

      md: app.Td // md type used by cl.create() to instantiate new md in cl
      ...
  )};
Run following in console to check it out:

secondTd = app.Tds.create({ tt: 'My second Td item'});
secondTd instanceof app.Td // returns true
Now refresh page and we should be able to see fruits of our labour.

The tds added through console should still appear in list since they are populated from Local Storage.
      Also, we should be able to createnew td by typingtt and pressing enter.


Excellent, we’re making great progress,
 but what about completing and deleting tds?

Completing & deleting tds
The next part of our tutorial is going to cover completing and deleting tds.
 These two actions are  spec to each Td item,
  so we need to add this functionality to TdVw view. 
  We will do so by adding 
  togglecompleted() 
  and 
  clear() 
  mets along with corresponding entries in evs hash.


  // js/views/tds.js

      <script>


  app = app || {};

  // Td Item Vw  // The DOM el for td item...
  
  
  app.TdVw = bb.V.x({

  
    tagName: 'li',
    tp: _.tp( $('#item-tp').h() ),   // Cache tp function forsingle item.

    // The DOM evs  spec to item.
    evs: {      'click .toggle': 'togglecompleted',       'dblclick label': 'edit',      'click .destroy': 'clear',           *
      'keypress .edit': 'updateOnEnter',
      'blur .edit': 'close' },

    // The TdVw listens for changes to its md, re-rendering. Since there's
    //one-to-one correspondence between**Td** and**TdVw** in this
    // app, we setdirect reference on md for convenience.
    i: function() {
      this.l2(this.md, 'change', this.render);
      this.l2(this.md, 'destroy', this.rm);        *
      this.l2(this.md, 'visible', this.toggleVisible); *
    },

    // Re-render tts of td item.
    r: function() {
      this.$el.h( this.tp( this.md.atts ) );

      this.$el.toggleClass( 'completed', this.md.get('completed') ); *
      this.toggleVisible();    this.$input = this.$('.edit');
      return this;
    },


    toggleVisible:function(){this.$el.toggleClass( 'hidden',  this.isHidden())},//    * - Toggles visibility of item


  //  * - Determines if item should be hidden
    isHidden : function () {isCompleted = this.md.get('completed')
    
    // hidden cases only
      return (!isCompleted && app.TdFilter === 'completed')  || (isCompleted && app.TdFilter === 'active')     },

 
    togglecompleted: function() {     this.md.toggle()    },  // * - Toggle `"completed"` state of md.

    // Switch this view into `"editing"` mode, displaying input field.
    edit: function() {  this.$el.K('editing');    this.$input.focus() },


    // Close `"editing"` mode, saving changes to td.
    close: function() {
      val = this.$input.val().trim();
      if ( val ) {        this.md.save({ tt: val })      } else {    this.clear(); *      }
      this.$el.xK('editing');
    },



    // If you hit `enter`, we're through editing item.
    
    updateOnEnter: function( e ) {      if ( e.which === ENTER_KEY ) {     this.close()      }    },

  //  * - Remove item, destroy md from *localStorage* and delete its view.
    clear: function() {      this.md.destroy();    }
  
  })
      </script>
The key part of this is two event handlers we’ve added, 
a togglecompleted event on td’s checkbox, 
andclick event on td’s <bt class="destroy" /> bt.

Let’s look at evs that occur when we click checkbox fortd item:

The togglecompleted() function is invoked which calls toggle() on td md.
toggle() toggles completed status of td and calls save() on md.
The save generateschange event on md which is bound to our TdVw’s r() met. 
We’ve addedstatement in r() which toggles completed class 
on el depending on md’s completed state. The associated CSS changes
 color of tt text and strikesline through it when td is completed.
The save also results inchange:completed event on md which is handled by
 AppVw’s filterOne() met. If we look back at AppVw, we see that filterOne()
  will triggervisible event on md. This is used in conjunction with filtering
   in our routes and cls so that we only display item if its completed state falls
    in line with current filter. In our update to TdVw, we bound md’s visible event
     to toggleVisible() met. This met uses new isHidden() met to determine if
      td should be visible and updates it accordingly.
Now let’s look at what happens when we click ontd’s destroy bt:

The clear() met is invoked which calls destroy() on td md.
The td is deleted from local storage anddestroy event is triggered.
In our update to TdVw, we bound md’s destroy event to view’s inherited rm() met.
      This met deletes view and automatically rms associated el from DOM.
 Since we used l2() to bind view’s listeners to its md,
      rm() also unbinds listening cbs from md ensuring thatmemory leak does not occur.
destroy() also rms md from Tds cl, which triggersrm event on cl.
Since AppVw has its r() met bound to all evs on Tds cl, that view is rendered and stats in footer are updated.
That’s all there is to it!

If you want to see example of those, see complete source.

Td routing
Finally, we move on to routing, which will allow us to easily filter list of items that are active as well as those which have been completed.
We’ll be supporting following routes:

#/ (all - default)
#/active
#/completed

When route changes, td list will be filtered onmd level and selected class on filter links in footer will be toggled as described above.
 When item is updated whilefilter is active it will be updated accordingly (e.g., if filter is active and item is checked, it will be hidden).
  The active filter is persisted on reload.


  // js/routers/router.js

  // Td Router
  // ----------
<script>


  app = app || {};

  Workspace = bb.Rt.x({
    routes:{
      '*filter': 'setFilter'
    },

    setFilter: function( param ) {
      // Set current filter to be used
      if (param) {
        param = param.trim();
      }
      app.TdFilter = param || '';

      // Triggercl filter event, causing hiding/unhiding
      // of Td view items
      app.Tds.trigger('filter');
    }
  });

  app.TdRouter = new Workspace();
  bb.history.start();

      </script>


Our router uses *splat to set updefault route which passes string after ‘#/’ in URL to setFilter() which sets app.TdFilter to that string.


      As we can see in line app.Tds.trigger('filter'),
      once filter has been set, we simply trigger ‘filter’ on our Tds cl to toggle which items are visible and which are hidden.

      Recall that our AppVw’s filterAll() met is bound to cl’s filter event and that any event on cl will cause AppVw to re-render.

      Finally, we create instance of our router and call bb.history.start() to route initial URL during page load.
